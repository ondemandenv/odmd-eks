The code is part of an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) project and includes two files: `eks-stack.ts` and `eks.ts`. These files are used to define and deploy an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster along with related infrastructure components. Here's a breakdown of what each file does:

---

#### **1. `lib/eks-stack.ts`**
- This file defines a custom CDK stack class (`GyangEksCluster`) that extends `cdk.NestedStack`.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
   - Creates and configures an EKS cluster.
   - Sets up network infrastructure (VPC, NAT gateways, subnets).
   - Configures Kubernetes manifests for the cluster.
   - Manages IAM roles and policies for the EKS cluster, including admin, user, and lambda roles.
   - Adds node groups to the cluster with specific instance types (e.g., T3.medium and T3a.medium) and configurations.
   - Implements security group rules and routing configurations.
   - Outputs important role ARNs for use in other stacks or environments.

**Key Components:**
- **VPC Setup:** Creates private and public subnets, NAT gateways, and route tables.
- **EKS Cluster Configuration:** Specifies the Kubernetes version, enable encryption, and configures IPv6 CIDR blocks.
- **Roles and Policies:** Defines IAM roles for cluster administration, user access, and lambda functions. It ensures these roles can be trusted across different AWS accounts (multi-account setup).
- **Node Groups:** Adds worker nodes to the EKS cluster with specific configurations, including instance types (e.g., `T3.medium`, `T3a.medium`), key pairs, and scaling policies.
- **CNI Configuration:** Configures ENI-based CNI (Container Network Interface) for Kubernetes networking in AWS VPC.

#### **2. `bin/eks.ts`**
- This file is the entry point script that initializes the CDK stack.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
   - Sets up environment variables and retrieves account details from AWS IAM.
   - Initializes the EKS cluster stack (`GyangEksCluster`) with parameters derived from the environment setup.
   - Creates an additional stack (`SimpleK8sManifestStack`) to deploy Kubernetes manifests.

**Flow of Execution:**
1. Checks environment variables for region and account information.
2. Uses `OndemandContractsEnvironSetup` to get organizational ID and account information.
3. Initializes the `<stack>` with the retrieved parameters.
4. Logs progress and initializes a secondary stack for deploying additional configurations or manifests.

### **Overall Purpose:**
The code is designed to automate the deployment of an EKS cluster along with its supporting infrastructure (e.g., VPC, IAM roles, security groups) using AWS CDK. It also ensures proper configuration of Kubernetes clusters for production workloads by setting up IAM policies, node groups, and network configurations.

### **Key Features:**
- Multi-account support (IAM role trust policies).
- IPv6-enabled EKS cluster.
- Kubernetes manifest deployment.
- Secure infrastructure setup with VPC, NAT gateways, and security groups.

This setup is ideal for organizations looking to deploy secure, scalable, and highly available Kubernetes workloads on AWS.
